## About this bot

ðŸš§ Our bot is a game of identifying famous people. Each time the bot sends a pixelated image of a celebrity and the participant guesses. If he is right, the bot will return a sticker of the famous person with a famous quote from him. If the participant made a mistake, he will receive a funny "encouragement" sentence. In addition, the bot updates the participant's score at each stage.
